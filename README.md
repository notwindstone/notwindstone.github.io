## Getting started

Click on the `./src/index.html` file to open the **unminified** website.

If you want to change the content, you should edit files in the `./src` folder.

To minify the code first install dependencies:

```bash
bun i
```

Then run the minify command:

```bash
bun minify
```

A minified code will be stored in the `./dist` folder.
